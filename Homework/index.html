    Typography and text properties are essential aspects of web design, as they define how content appears and is read by users. In this assignment, 
    we explored the concepts of font-family, font-size, font-style, and other text-related CSS properties to enhance the presentation of a webpage. 
    The thoughtful application of these properties helps create a clear visual hierarchy and improves readability, ensuring a better user experience

    We experimented with properties like text-transform, text-decoration, 
    and text-indent to add stylistic elements to our webpage. For instance, 
    ppercase transformation in headings and indents in paragraphs helped in creating a professional and clean layout.
     Additionally, using text-overflow with ellipses provided a practical solution for handling overflowing content.
     This approach ensures a balance between aesthetics and functionality.

    Lastly, pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after were utilized to add decorative elements without cluttering the HTML structure. 
    These, along with proper alignment and spacing, showcase how CSS can bring structure and style together in web development. 
    This assignment not only enhanced our understanding of typography but also allowed us to apply creative solutions to common design challenges.
